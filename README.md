# WORLD-LAID-OFF-DATA
DATA CLEANING AND EXPLORATION WITH SQL
In this project several cleaning had to be done before exploring data.
I had to remove duplicates from the rows
I also had to trim the data to remove extra spaces
Some colums were not well formatted or formatted wrongly whilst others were rightly formatted so i had to standardize the formatting
The date was in a text format so i had to update it to date format
There were rows with empty cells although they shouldn't have been since they have names etc so i had to update the table with their names for those rows
Finally i did some exploratory analysis to find the min and max years when the layoffs happened,the countries with the highest layoff and the year with most layoff etc.
Note that all these was done using MySQL
